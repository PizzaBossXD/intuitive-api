# Intuitive API

## This is the documentation for Intuitive API

### Intuitive API - Quickly setup an API for any use case, from messing around to making a real-life startup!

#

### To create a new router, visit the versions folder in /api and create a new version OR use an existing one and create a new file in that folder's /routers folder and make sure to name that file in the same name as the router's API route URL, basically, if the file is named helloworld.js then reaching /api/v[whatever version]/helloworld in the browser or whatever you're using, would work... also, make sure you make and export a router in that file because if you don't, express will throw an error...

#

### It's unnecessary to change stuff in the cdn router or cdn folder... if you want to add a new cdn type, just make a new folder, if you want custom configuration in the cdn such as custom content delivery options and/or custom options and maybe making it limited to permissions, make sure you do edit the cdn router.

#

### This API Generator is mostly used for a working intuitive API, and not that much for a CDN... But it still has a working CDN (tested) that you can mess around with, maybe use in production or something...

Sorry if the documentation sucked...I hope it was easy to understand how to use this API, any issues? https://github.com/PizzaBossXD,
Feel free to use this API Generator for any kind of project ðŸ˜Š

```css
Also, to make a new cdn, create a new folder and name it whatever name you want for the cdn routes to be, in the /cdn folder
```
